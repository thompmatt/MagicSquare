# MagicSquare
This program creates a "Magic Square", which is an odd N x N matrix (where N is greater than 3) whose columns and rows all yield the same number if added up. With this program, I learned/practiced the following topics:
- C File I/O
- C Structs (Stack and Heap)
- More practice with memory management and heap allocators (such as malloc(), calloc(), free())

In essence, a Magic Square of size 3 should look like this:
```
2 7 6
9 5 1
4 3 5
```
Where row 1 is (2 + 7 + 6) = 15, row 2 is (9 + 5 + 1) = 15, etc., and where column 1 (2 + 9 + 4) = 15, etc.
